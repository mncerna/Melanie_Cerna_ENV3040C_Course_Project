# Melanie_Cerna_ENV3040C_Course_Project
Course Project for Computational Methods in Environmental Engineering, evaluating correlations between metal concentrations in drinking water
Ravalli_2021_datasets_and_codebook_2.tsv contains all the drinking water metal concentrations for all counties in the United States
Ravalli_2021_datasets_and_codebook_3.tsv contains the initial county drinking water metal data plus demographic data (pnly contains problematic counties)
census_data_for_prob_counties.xlsx contains the census data just for the problematic counties and is what was used to make Ravalli_2021_datasets_and_codebook_3.tsv
Cerna_Melanie_CourseProject.ipynb is the actual Jupyter notebook containing the code for this course project
Another zipped file will be included in the canvas submission that was too big to be included here, just to show the initial file with census data.
